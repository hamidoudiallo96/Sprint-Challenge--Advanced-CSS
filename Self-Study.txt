Questions:


1.) What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

    Adaptive design uses a breakpoint to trigger different screen sizes. Each layout is predefined. AWD targets breakpoints.

    Responsive design similar to adaptive design, but it incorporates a fluid design, so that breakpoints are not necessary. RWD targets certain devices.
    

2.) Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

    Mobile first refers to building out your site on a mobile view first. Typically the width of the site is set to 500px and min-width is utilized to create layouts of larger screens(i.e. tablets and desktops).
    Desktop first is the opposite of the mobile firt. Typically the width is set between 800-1000px and max-width is utilized to scale down the site for mobile and tablet view.



3.) What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

    The default font size on most browsers are about 16px. 62.5% of 16px is 10px and that allows us have an easier time scaling our font-sizes with a base of 10.



4.) How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

    Preprocessing allows developers to write css syntax in  different ways. Preprocessors are usually more time efficient for developers when styling their css.




5.) What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

    Definitely nesting and media queries. Its so much more time efficeint to style css in this way. I had trouble with media queries initially, but that was a misunderstanding on my part.
